Chan Narith, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Economy and Finance and a member of the Royal Government Working Group in Ponhea Leu district, Kandal province, has called on Cambodian workers who recently returned from Thailand to work diligently for the betterment of their families and the national economy.

His remarks were made on October 5 while presiding over a Job Forum and Job Search Registration Program organized at the foot of Reach Troap Mountain in Ponhea Leu District. The event aimed to assist returning workers and job seekers by connecting them directly with company representatives and officials from the National Employment and Labor Agency. The program was attended by around 300 participants, including the Governor of Ponhea Leu District, provincial department heads, local authorities, company representatives, and citizens.



Narith said that Cambodia currently faces no shortage of job opportunities, particularly in the country’s growing industrial and economic zones, which are in need of labor and offer various benefits.

He also encouraged citizens—especially members of equity card-holding and vulnerable families—to register for vocational training under the Government’s Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) program. This initiative provides free training, monthly stipends, and practical skills to help participants take advantage of abundant job opportunities across the country.

Narith added that, thanks to the efforts of Prime Minister Hun Manet, the United States has recently reduced the tariff rate on Cambodian goods to 19 percent. This development is expected to attract more foreign investment, leading to increased job creation—especially for skilled labor.
