Bun Rany Hun Sen, President of the Cambodian Red Cross (CRC), led a mission to deliver emergency relief to 1,800 flood-affected families in Thbong Khmum district. This aid was funded by a $20,000 donation from Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk.

Each family received a package containing 30 kg of rice, a box of noodles, 10 cans of fish, soy sauce, fish sauce, cooking oil, body soap, and detergent. Additionally, each household was given 50,000 riels from Vong Sauth and local representatives, along with bread and bottled water from the provincial CRC branch.

Pregnant women and women of reproductive age received hygiene kits from UNFPA. Mrs. Ou Thyda Poeuv Kuoch Chamroeun also donated $10,000 for further CRC activities.

To improve healthcare support, Bun Rany Hun Sen donated 15,600 ACETA-SANT 500 tablets to health departments in Tbong Khmum and Kampong Cham provinces. He also shared a royal message from the King and Queen Mother, expressing their support for the affected families.
