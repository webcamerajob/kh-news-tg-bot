Synopsis: The World Health Organization has found no evidence supporting claims that the coronavirus shots cause cancer, says the ministry, after a South Korean study reported in the UK’s Daily Mail newspaper suggested a link between vaccinations and six types of cancer, particularly in adults over 65.

The Health Ministry has denied reports claiming that COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of cancer The ministry emphasised that, to date, the World Health Organization (WHO) has found no evidence supporting such claims.

Concerns arose after the UK’s Daily Mail newspaper published a September 29 report on a South Korean study suggesting a possible link between COVID-19 vaccination and an increased risk of six types of cancer, particularly in adults over 65.

The study claimed associations with cancers such as lung, breast, and prostate, but did not explain the underlying mechanisms. Experts have widely dismissed the study as “superficially alarming” and cautioned that its conclusions are greatly exaggerated.

In response, Cambodia’s Department of Communicable Disease Control stated: “There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine can cause cancer.”

Medical and cancer organisations, including the WHO, International Agency for Research on Cancer, the US National Cancer Institute, and the American Cancer Society, have declared that COVID-19 vaccines are not linked to increased cancer risk.

The Ministry of Health reported that as of late last week, Cambodia has recorded no new COVID-19 cases.

Since the pandemic began in early 2020, Cambodia has reported 139,648 COVID-19 cases, with 136,592 recoveries and 3,056 deaths.

As of November 2024, 95.73% of Cambodia’s 16 million population have been vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccine coverage includes 15.3 million first doses, 14.7 million second doses, 10.8 million third doses, 5.4 million fourth doses, 210,003 fifth doses, and nearly 592,000 sixth doses. Vaccines administered include Sinopharm, AstraZeneca (Covishield), Sinovac, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Moderna, and Pfizer.
