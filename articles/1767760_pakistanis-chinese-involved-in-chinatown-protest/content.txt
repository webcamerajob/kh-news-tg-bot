Synopsis: Preah Sihanouk authorities clarify that the recent protest in Chinatown was the result of a conflict between Pakistani employees and their Chinese employers, not Indonesian and Indian nationals as reported on social media.

Preah Sihanouk Deputy Governor Long Dimanche has issued a statement to address widespread misinformation surrounding a recent protest in the city’s Chinatown area.

Contrary to widely shared social media reports, the protest did not primarily involve Indonesian or Indian nationals. Instead, the event was a violent conflict between Pakistani employees and their Chinese employers.

The clarification follows a viral Facebook post featuring several short video clips showing unrest and property damage at a building in Sihanoukville’s Chinatown.

The post claimed that “thousands of Indonesian and Indian nationals staged a protest” and that the residential building housing Chinatown employees was destroyed during the unrest, which reportedly occurred at 12.20am yesterday. The claims quickly generated concern among local residents and international communities alike.

Dimanche emphasised that the information in the post was inaccurate and urged the public and media to depend solely on official sources.

“There was indeed a violent confrontation, but it involved Pakistani workers and Chinese employers, not Indonesian or Indian nationals,” he said.

According to Dimanche, the unrest stemmed from escalating disagreements after certain remarks related to religious beliefs deeply offended the Pakistani employees, leading to the outbreak of violence.

In the aftermath, Sihanoukville police detained more than 50 Pakistanis and two Chinese nationals for questioning. An investigation is underway.

The Deputy Governor noted that authorities are still assessing the full extent of the damage caused during the protest, with details yet to be released as police continue to monitor the situation closely.

The incident drew a response from the Indonesian Embassy. Ambassador Santo Darmosumarto spoke out to correct the misrepresentation of Indonesian nationals’ involvement.

He reaffirmed the embassy’s commitment to ensuring that Indonesian citizens in Cambodia comply with local laws and maintain peaceful behaviour.

“The Embassy consistently advises all Indonesians residing in Cambodia to abide by the Kingdom’s laws and respect the local community and environment,” Ambassador Darmosumarto said.

Sihanoukville, known for its vibrant multicultural workforce and booming economic activity, has seen increasing tensions related to labour disputes among the foreign communities. The incident highlighted the delicate balance authorities must maintain in managing ethnic and cultural differences, particularly in rapidly developing urban areas.

Local officials stressed the importance of avoiding misinformation that could inflame tensions and undermine public safety.
