Synopsis: Education Minister sets the date for the opening of the 2025–2026 academic year while also calling for a report on the schools damaged by shelling and a proposal for alternative locations for students to commence classes without further disruption.

The 2025–2026 academic year will start on November 1. Education, Youth and Sport Minister Hang Chuon Naron announced this at a meeting held last week to prepare for the new school year.

Enrolments for young children will open from October 15 to 31.

However, schools in the provinces affected by the recent armed conflict will not be able to reopen as scheduled because of the instability along the Cambodian-Thai border. The situation has prevented construction teams from accessing the sites, delaying restoration efforts.

“Regarding preparations for the new school year, schools along the border impacted by the conflict with Thailand cannot yet reopen,” Naron said. “The unstable security situation is preventing demining and reconstruction teams from entering and restoring these schools.”

He added that the Ministry of Education has set aside funds for the restoration of the affected schools. This includes funding from the ministry’s own budget as well as support from development partners, including national and international donors.

Naron directed the working group to prepare a comprehensive report on the current status of affected schools and to identify safe temporary locations for continued teaching and learning. This is to ensure that students can still access quality, equitable, and safe education despite the disruptions.

Ministry spokeswoman Khuon Vichheka said: “The ministry is currently assessing the situation to determine when it will be safe to reopen the affected schools.”

In addition to planning for the school year’s launch and restoring conflict-affected schools, the meeting also focused on expanding secondary education and introducing new educational pathways.

Following Prime Minister Hun Manet’s directive, the ministry will begin implementing a learning-oriented education reform for junior high school and high school students. Starting in the 2025–2026 academic year, selected high schools will pilot new academic pathways in science, social science, and vocational studies, beginning from Grade 10.

To ensure smooth implementation, Naron instructed the working group to develop a detailed plan outlining the actual needs for: Opening of the 2025–2026 school year, Expansion of secondary schools, Pilot implementation of new educational pathways, Restoration of border schools impacted by conflict, and A detailed report on the condition of affected schools and proposed temporary learning sites.

According to ministry reports, at least seven primary schools in Preah Vihear and Oddar Meanchey provinces were damaged during a five-day exchange of fire between Cambodian and Thai military forces. The Thai army reportedly shelled the area, damaging several school buildings.

Techo Bosbov Primary School (Choam Ksan district, Preah Vihear) was 90% destroyed, with unexploded ordnance still present on school grounds.

Tamoan Senchey Primary School (Oddar Meanchey) was also nearly completely destroyed.

Say Monorom Primary School (Banteay Ampil district, Oddar Meanchey) sustained damage to one building.
