Synopsis: Russian Ambassador seeks enhanced partnership with Cambodia in demining efforts.

Russian Ambassador to Cambodia Anatoly Borovik called for closer cooperation between Russia and Cambodia in the field of mine action, emphasising the importance of knowledge exchange and technical collaboration.

During a bilateral meeting with Ly Thuch, First Vice-President of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA) on Friday, Ambassador Borovik expressed his country’s intention to strengthen bilateral ties with Cambodia and welcomed the upcoming visit of a Russian delegation and experts next year to study Cambodia’s mine action operations.

Borovik commended the Cambodian government’s efforts and achievements in mine clearance.

He praised the vision of Prime Minister Hun Manet, to achieve a mine-free Cambodia by 2030 and highlighted the importance of cooperation between the two countries in this field.

Borovik requested CMAA’s support for the Russian delegation’s visit, which aims to study and learn from Cambodia’s experience in mine action operations.

Thuch expressed his appreciation for Russia’s continued friendship and support. He reaffirmed Cambodia’s readiness to welcome the Russian delegation and facilitate their study visit next year.



He noted that Cambodia and Russia have enjoyed more than six decades of close and historic relations, particularly in areas such as human resource development, technical training, and education.

“Russia and Cambodia have cooperated in many sectors over the past 60 years,” he said. “Russia recognises Cambodia’s great progress and extensive experience in mine clearance operations. At the same time, Russia possesses advanced technology and modern equipment in this sector, which Cambodia can learn from and apply to speed up mine clearance operations.”

Thuch added that the exchange of technical expertise and experience would be mutually beneficial.
