Synopsis: The Ministry of Environment takes action against an Indian-owned mining company in Ratanakiri province after the site is found to have contaminated a nearby stream connected to O’Yadav River.

The Ministry of Environment has taken swift action against mining company Mesco Gold (Cambodia) Ltd after discovering that its mining site had discharged wastewater into a stream in Ratanakiri province and causing harm to aquatic life.

An inspection team led by Oung Vuthy, Deputy Director of the Department of Environmental Protection, conducted the field visit on Saturday.

The team confirmed that liquid waste had leaked from the company premises into the nearby stream of O’Tray. The stream flows into the O’Yadav River, raising serious concerns about broader ecological impacts. Laboratory samples collected from five sites revealed that the leakage had significantly reduced oxygen levels in the water, resulting in the death of fish and threatening the local ecosystem.

Following the investigation, the Ministry of Environment issued a formal order demanding that the company take immediate corrective measures. The company was instructed to cease all wastewater discharges immediately, face administrative penalties under the Law on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Management (Articles 156, 173, 287, and 694) and Sub-Decree No. 27 on Water Pollution Control, and compensate for environmental and public health damages.

In addition, the company must upgrade its wastewater treatment system to meet national technical standards, comply fully with its environmental and social impact assessment commitments, and contribute to the required environmental and social funds. Mesco Gold was also ordered to pump wastewater from sediment ponds into properly lined temporary storage ponds, or construct additional ponds as needed, and repair all leakage points.

The ministry gave the company until yesterday to obey the order and report back to both the Provincial Department of Environment and the Ministry of Environment.

The actions are mandatory and non-negotiable, underscoring the government’s firm stance on protecting public water sources, community health, and natural ecosystems from industrial pollution.

According to the ministry, as of August, 52 factories have signed compliance agreements, with 42 already installing automatic monitoring systems.

The ministry said all industrial sites with potential pollution sources must comply with the Environmental and Natural Resources Code, particularly Articles 178, 287, 288, and 829, which govern wastewater and pollutant discharge, and Article 845, which addresses non-compliance in wastewater management.

High-risk polluters are required to install and operate wastewater treatment facilities and automatic monitoring equipment.
