Synopsis: At the UN Human Rights Council, the Cambodian envoy condemns ‘xenophobic acts’ perpetrated against the country’s citizens in Thailand, while rejecting international claims of repression and human rights infringements.

Cambodia’s representative voiced grave concerns last week at the UN over what he described as the “xenophobic acts and racist violence” of Thailand while also responding to concerns raised by some stakeholders regarding Cambodia’s human rights situation.

Speaking in a general debate on Thursday at the 60th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Ambassador In Dara, Permanent Representative of Cambodia to the United Nations, in Geneva, said Cambodians in Thailand have suffered racial discrimination and xenophobia amid the border row between the two countries.

“Amid the ongoing armed conflict along our border, we have witnessed, beyond our frontiers, an escalation of xenophobic acts and racist violence targeting our nationals in Thailand—particularly migrant workers and students,” he said.

These Cambodians have become targets of hateful attacks, harassment, and discriminatory rhetoric, Dara added.

“These acts not only harm the victims but also poison relations between peoples and erode the spirit of solidarity that underpins multilateralism,” he said.

“Even more alarming is the proliferation of disinformation campaigns that distort facts, fuel prejudice, and expose innocent communities to unjustified risks. Such practices stand in stark contradiction to the international obligations of States—to guarantee non-discrimination, equality before the law, and the security and dignity of all persons under their jurisdiction.”

Dara emphasised that Cambodia, a country committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and the principles of equality, dignity and universality, cannot remain silent in the face of the troubling developments.

“Combating racism, xenophobia, and intolerance is not a political choice but a legal and moral imperative,” Dara said. “Cambodia urges the Council to remain vigilant and to strengthen its cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner so that every human being, regardless of origin or status, may live free from fear, hatred, and discrimination.”

At the same event in New York on Friday, UN rapporteurs, human rights organisations and several countries, particularly the United Kingdom expressed concern over human rights in Cambodia.

The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) told the UN Human Rights Council that Cambodia is using the Thai-Cambodian border crisis to suppress dissent and restrict civic space, citing the arrest of opposition members and journalists, as well as new nationality law amendments that could silence critics.

FIDH also warned of the negative social and economic impacts of Cambodia’s planned military conscription and mass return of migrant workers. The organisation called for the release of 79 people imprisoned on politically motivated charges, including activists from Mother Nature Cambodia.

Although she acknowledged Cambodia development goals, UK Human Rights Ambassador Eleanor Sanders highlighted the ongoing issues related to human rights in Cambodia, including the abuses linked to online scams and restrictions on civil and political rights.

“We are deeply concerned by reports of trafficking and forced labour linked to the online scamming industry. We encourage stronger, more consistent law enforcement and victim support,” she said.

According to Sanders, democratic principles in the Kingdom is being challenged by judicial harassment of the opposition, human rights activists, and journalists.

“We are particularly concerned by the wide application of Article 495 of the Penal Code on incitement and its chilling effect on freedom of expression,” she added.

Sanders urged Cambodia follow the Special Rapporteur’s recommendations, including on strengthening judicial independence and enabling civil society to operate freely, stressing that inclusive dialogue and the participation of all stakeholders, will restore confidence and stability of the next election.

“A vibrant press, active civil society and respect for freedom of expression will not only reinforce democratic principles, but also support Cambodia’s long-term prosperity and international reputation,” she said.

In his response the same day, Ambassador Dara rejected FIDH’s claims, especially one accusing the Cambodian government of using the Thai-Cambodian border crisis as a pretext to suppress dissent and restrict civic space. He said the accusations were selective, distorted, and politically motivated.

The Cambodian delegation, in a statement, dismissed the allegations as unfounded and misleading. It said the claim of a “shrinking civic space” does not hold up against evidence, noting that Cambodia is home to over 6,000 registered organisations and more than 2,000 media outlets, many of which are openly critical of the government.

“These are not signs of contraction but of vitality. Civil society thrives because peace and stability have given it fertile ground,” Dara said.

The Cambodian Ambassador to the UN also rejected FIDH’s assertions of “mass arrests,” “persecution of dissent,” and “judicial lawfare,” stating that “no one in Cambodia is prosecuted for political beliefs.” It stressed that prosecutions arise only from violations of the law, including incitement to violence, racial hatred, or threats to public order.

“To label every lawful conviction as ‘repression’ is to distort justice,” he added, invoking Article 19(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which recognises limits to free expression to protect public order and security.

On the issue online scams, Dara acknowledged the seriousness of the problem but rejected claims of inaction.

“These transnational syndicates have been met with dismantled networks, rescued victims, prosecuted perpetrators, and deepened regional cooperation—clear evidence of resolve, not failure,” he said.

On environmental governance, the delegation said Cambodia does not deny its challenges but is actively reforming its systems through law, consultation, and reform. It argued that FIDH’s report presented a “partial picture,” ignoring progress in sustainable development, environmental protection, and social welfare.

“Civic and political space in Cambodia is not flawless—no country’s is,” the statement continued. “But it is dynamic and evolving, with wider consultations, greater digital access, and judicial reforms reinforcing independence.”

The delegation emphasised that civil and political freedoms cannot exist without economic and social rights, criticising what it described as the FIDH’s “selectivity and imbalance” for focusing narrowly on civic issues while neglecting Cambodia’s socio-economic progress.

“Cambodia does not claim perfection. But we do claim progress,” Dara added. “We rebuilt institutions after war, restored stability, cleared millions of landmines, halved poverty, and expanded education and health. These are the true foundations upon which rights can flourish.”

According to the representative, Cambodia urged the UN Human Rights Council to assess reports on the country with fairness and impartiality.

“We call on the Council to recognise achievements as well as challenges, resist selectivity and politicisation, and affirm cooperation based on balance and mutual respect,” the statement said.

The delegation reaffirmed Cambodia’s “unwavering commitment to peace as the foundation of rights, to development as the path to dignity, and to the full enjoyment of all human rights for all our people.”
