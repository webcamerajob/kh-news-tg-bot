Synopsis: More than 2,500 families evacuated to safety amid extensive damage to crops.

People living close to riverbanks have been asked to be vigilant amid severe floods in nine provinces, as authorities step up an awareness campaign to follow safety instructions.

Soth Kimkolmony, spokesman for the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM), said yesterday that as of Saturday, flooding was reported in nine provinces, comprising Stung Treng, Kratie, Prey Veng, Kampong Thom, Banteay Meanchey, Tboung Khmum, Preah Vihear, Kandal, and Kampong Cham.

However, Siem Reap province has seen water levels recede. The province houses the famous Angkor Wat temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that draws tourists in large numbers.

Kampong Cham Deputy Governor Srey Sopheak said the administration has prepared 197 safety shelters across nine affected districts.

“We arrange these safe sites every year, and they are ready for use if evacuations become necessary,” he said, adding that no evacuations have been carried out as of now.

He added that the local authorities have intensified public awareness campaigns to urge people—especially those living along riverbanks vulnerable to erosion—to stay alert and follow safety instructions.

“The number of affected households has decreased significantly due to receding floodwaters in Siem Reap and Oddar Meanchey,” the NCDM spokesperson said. He added that more than 12,000 households in the nine provinces have been affected, with around 2,549 families evacuated to safety.

Floods have affected more than 18,620 hectares of paddy and other crops, with about 1,680 hectares destroyed, according to preliminary assessments.
