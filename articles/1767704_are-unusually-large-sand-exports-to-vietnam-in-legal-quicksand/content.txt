Synopsis: Spike in sand consignments from Cambodia to Vietnam raises eyebrows as concerns grow over environmental damage and loose regulatory oversight.

Prey Veng province– New data obtained from authorities overseeing Cambodia’s sand trade reveals a striking surge in exports to Vietnam in the first half of this year, sparking concerns over resource management and potential regulatory loopholes.

According to records, Vietnamese companies legally imported over 30 million cubic metres of sand from Cambodia through official channels at two Mekong River border gates in An Giang and Dong Thap provinces, with a declared total value of around $170 million.

This volume represents a continued increase in exports from 2024, raising questions over the long-term sustainability of Cambodia’s sand reserves and the oversight of cross-border trade.

Data also reveals a highly concentrated trade. The three largest Vietnamese importing companies accounted for more than a third of the total imports during the first six months of the year—Phuong Anh Construction Service Trading Company (nearly six million cubic metres), Thanh Tung Sand Company (nearly 4 million cubic metres) and Truong Thinh Mekong Joint Stock Company (about 3 million cubic metres).

While the transactions occurred through official import-export channels, observers warn that such large-scale extraction could have lasting environmental and economic consequences for Cambodia, particularly along the Mekong River where sand mining has been linked to riverbank erosion, loss of biodiversity, and community displacement.

Villagers living along the lower Mekong River in Prey Veng province have expressed growing concern over the ongoing erosion of their land caused by excessive sand extraction. Fears of further land loss intensify during the rainy season.

Sand dredging in the province has long been linked to serious environmental and social problems, including collapsing riverbanks, loss of farmland, and damage to homes. Despite protests by local communities since 2009, these concerns persist.

“I am very concerned because the riverbank collapses every year,” said Bou Phorn, a villager from Odong village, Prek Krabao commune. “Before, we could grow vegetables, but now everything is gone.”

The Ministry of Mines and Energy has clarified that all procedures for selling sand to foreign entities are conducted strictly through licenced Cambodian companies. It said that if a company is granted a licence to operate a sand business, it has the right to sell the sand it collects to any company or country of its choice.

According to a ministry spokesman, these transactions are carried out in a non-discriminatory manner, and Cambodian authorities welcome interest from foreign buyers wishing to purchase sand from Cambodia. Currently, three companies have licences from the ministry for sand extraction.

There are repeated calls for a closer investigation into the sufficiency of Cambodia’s regulatory framework to monitor and control the rapid export of this critical natural resource, and whether Vietnamese companies are adhering to environmental and legal standards.

Two licensed Cambodian companies, Chaktumok and Global Green, operate sand mines in the Mekong River within the province, under permits issued by the Ministry of Mines and Energy to extract and export sand.

According to reliable sources, the average selling price of sand from 2024 to now at these two mines has been about $5.5 per cubic metre, based on contracts filed with Vietnamese Customs. This price covers extraction, transport, and related costs, reported at an average of $6–6.2 per cubic metre.

Investigations involving shipowners, agents, and sand import businesses indicate that in Vietnam’s Mekong River area near buoy number 0, companies often sell sand at higher rates. Full vessel sales, which include “excess” or undeclared sand beyond import declarations (typically 10–20% per vessel), are offered at $7.2–7.5 per cubic metre. The overall average price for transported sand, including smuggled quantities, is estimated at $6.5–7 per cubic metre.

The sand exported from Cambodia is mainly fill sand with a particle size of 1.2–1.5mm. Coarser sand with particle size of 1.6–2.0mm is costlier but accounts for only 7–10% of imports into Vietnam. The data on imports, including enterprise-level quantities, was obtained from a state management agency in Vietnam, though the agency’s name is withheld to protect officials who provided the information.

In addition, Vietnamese authorities are investigating the activities of Hắc Văn Luỹ and Phương Anh Company. Luỹ and his family have long been linked to cross-border smuggling, previously dealing in sugar, wood, and gold, and more recently, in sand.

One of Luỹ’s companies is under investigation for tax evasion and the sale of invoices allegedly used to legalise smuggled sand linked to Phương Anh Company. The registered owner of this invoice-trading firm has reportedly fled, and Luỹ remains under close watch by customs officials in Vietnam.

In August, Water Resources and Meteorology Minister Thor Chetha called for strengthened efforts for sustainable sand resource management.

Chetha, who chairs the Sand Resource Management Committee, said clear regulations and monitoring mechanisms are critical to maintaining supply stability and preventing illegal dredging.

However, he stressed that an uninterrupted supply of sand is equally essential to sustaining investor confidence and meeting project timelines.
