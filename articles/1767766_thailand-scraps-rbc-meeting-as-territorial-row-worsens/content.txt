Synopsis: The Cambodia-Thailand border dispute escalates after the Cambodian army rejects a Thai demand to evict Cambodian civilians from contested areas in Banteay Meanchey province. The Thai military’s 1st Army Area has insisted that Cambodia submit an evacuation plan by October 7 as a condition for participating in the RBC meeting. Phnom Penh has dismissed the demand as inconsistent with previous agreements, saying such issues must be resolved through the Joint Boundary Commission.

Banteay Meanchey province – The Royal Cambodian Army (RCA) has rejected a request from the Royal Thai Army’s 1st Army Area to prepare an eviction plan for Cambodian civilians living in contested border zones, leading to the postponement of the upcoming Regional Border Committee (RBC) meetings and prompting Thailand to issue a new ultimatum.

In its response, Cambodia stated that several areas under its sovereignty in Prey Chan and Chouk Chey villages are currently being occupied by Thai nationals.

Thailand’s Sa Kaeo Provincial Administration has postponed its earlier plan to forcibly evict hundreds of Cambodian households in Prey Chan village, O’Beichoan commune, O’Chrov district, following the villagers’ firm resistance and commitment to defending their homes. A new ultimatum has been set for Tuesday.

As of yesterday, the confrontation between the two sides remained tense, with a risk of renewed clashes. Cambodian villagers have vowed to protect their homes, while Thai authorities insist on enforcing their territorial claims following five days of border fighting in July, which displaced thousands on both sides.

Thailand’s First Army Area has demanded that Cambodia submit an evacuation plan for its people residing in disputed areas by Tuesday, warning that failure to comply could result in a Thai boycott of upcoming bilateral talks.

In an urgent letter sent on Friday, the Thai army set the deadline as a precondition for its participation in the RBC meeting, scheduled for October 10–12 in Banteay Meanchey province. Thailand has called on Cambodia to evacuate its civilians from three contested locations in Sa Kaeo province—Ban Nong Chan and Ban Nong Ya Kaeo villages in Khok Sung district, and Ban Ta Phraya village in Ta Phraya district.

Similarly, villagers in Chouk Chey, known in Thai as “Nong Chan,” have been ordered to vacate by Friday, under threats of arrest and prosecution for non-compliance.

In a letter addressed to Lieutenant General Worayos Luangsuwan, Commander of Thailand’s 1st Army Area and Co-Chair of the RBC, Lieutenant General Ek Sam Aun, Commander of Cambodia’s 5th Military Region, rejected Thai land’s proposal linking its participation in the RBC meeting to Cambodia’s preparation of an eviction plan for residents in three disputed areas opposite Nong Chan, Nong Ya Kaeo, and Ta Phraya.

Lt Gen Ek Sam Aun said such a condition was inconsistent with the spirit of previous agreements between both sides, particularly those reached at the 1st Special General Border Committee (GBC) meeting in Koh Kong province on 10 September.

“The proposal for the RBC meeting between the 5th Military Region and the 1st Army Area is consistent with the spirit and outcomes of the 1st Special GBC Meeting, as well as the First Extraordinary RBC Meeting held on 22 August 2025,” Lt Gen Ek Sam Aun stated in the letter.

The Cambodian side reiterated that matters concerning Chouk Chey and Prey Chan villages must be addressed strictly within the framework of agreed mechanisms, particularly through the Joint Boundary Commission (JBC)—the only body authorised to conduct joint surveys and boundary demarcation.

“The RBC at the regional level is only authorised to address local incidents, de-escalate tensions, and resolve issues on the ground through peaceful means. It does not have the mandate or authority to determine or alter the boundary line,” the letter read.

He called on both sides to respect existing agreements and refrain from unilateral actions until the next JBC meeting is convened.

“The 5th Military Region calls for full respect of agreements reached during past GBC and RBC meetings,” he said, reaffirming Cambodia’s commitment to peaceful dialogue and the protection of civilians on both sides of the border.

Cambodia is scheduled to host the RBC meeting between the Thai Army’s Region 1 and Cambodia’s 5th Military Region on Otcotber 10 to 12 in Banteay Meanchey province.

According to the Ministry of National Defence, the RBC meeting between Cambodia’s Military Region 3 and Thailand’s Chanthaburi-Trat Border Defence Command was scheduled for October 4–6 in Koh Kong province. Another meeting between Cambodia’s Military Region 4 and Thailand’s Army Region 2 was expected to follow on October 7–9 in Oddar Meanchey province.

However, Lt Gen Wirayut Raksil, Commander of Thailand’s 2nd Army Region, said the Thai and Cambodian secretariats met on October 3 to review proposals ahead of the RBC meetings.

Thailand proposed personnel withdrawals and mine clearance in disputed areas, but these remain preliminary as Cambodia has not yet responded. The RBC meeting is therefore expected to be postponed until mid-October.

The 5th Military Region also reiterated that several areas under Cambodian sovereignty in Prey Chan and Chouk Chey villages are currently occupied by Thai nationals.

“On-the-ground observations have clearly shown that in some areas, Thai nationals are occupying and using land within Cambodian sovereignty,” Lt Gen Ek Sam Aun wrote. “This situation underscores the complexity and sensitivity of border issues, which must be resolved in full respect of previously agreed principles.”

At the contested site in Banteay Meanchey province, Hul Malis, 52, and her family of five were forced to leave their home when Thai soldiers attempted to seize territory along the border village of Prey Chan on August 13.

“We were suddenly forced to leave our home. Since then, we have been homeless,” Malis said.

Now sheltering in a makeshift tent near the barbed wire fence on the Cambodian side, she waits for a peaceful resolution and hopes one day to return home.

“We won’t give up hope. We will struggle until the end—we have nowhere else to go,” she said. “We have to stand firm for our nation and for the next generation. If we’re not resisting now—we simply have no place to live. They are like thieves and robbers.”

Malis urged the international community to pay close attention and intervene to end what she described as Thai aggression.

Before the recent tensions, Prey Chan, which borders Nong Ya Kaew in Thailand’s Sa Kaeo province, was a peaceful community where residents on both sides shared close ties and even referred to one another as “friends.”

Villagers said that friendship has turned into hostility.

“We never wanted to see this situation,” said a villager. “But we have no choice—we must protect our homes and our land from being taken.”

Anger over what locals describe as Thai encroachment has united the community, which has clashed with Thai soldiers several times since August.

The most recent confrontationlast month left at least 30 Cambodians injured, including monks and soldiers.
